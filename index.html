    <h1>STEM's Stereotypes</h1>
    <p>
      STEM's Stereotypes are generally something like "STEM students are smart
      people", "STEM is only for smart people" and "STEM is hard". Now, we can't
      say that these are all just claims without basis because it is somewhat
      true. That's why in this website we're going to talk about STEM and the
      reasons why these kinds of stereotypes are generated.

    <h3 id="definition">What is STEM?</h3>
    <p>
      You've likely heard the term STEM, but what does it stand for? STEM is an
      acronym for science, technology, engineering, and math. These four fields
      share an emphasis on innovation, problem-solving, and critical thinking.
      And together they make up a popular and fast-growing industry.
    </p>
    <h3 id="difference">
      What is the difference between STEM and other strands?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The difference of the STEM curriculum with the other strands and tracks is
      the focus on <b>advanced concepts and topics</b>. Under the track, you can
      become a pilot, an architect, an astrophysicist, a biologist, a chemist,
      an engineer, a dentist, a nutritionist, a nurse, a doctor, and a lot more.
    </p>
    <h3 id="reason">What makes STEM hard?</h3>
    <p>STEM is hard in many ways.</p>
    <p>
      STEM requires more rigor and focus. There is not a “subjective, emotional”
      part of any of it other than the starting point for being “objective and
      rational”. And there is a ton of the latter. In fact, there is probably no
      other field of study that is nearly as much so.
    </p>
    <p>
      STEM requires attention to details that often go beyond what is required
      for other subjects (e.g. in English you have grammar and spelling which is
      comparable but these days those are often considered “optional and not
      important” because it is deemed “subjective”).
    </p>
    <p>
      STEM DOES require decent amounts of rote learning - anyone who says it
      does not has never actually worked in STEM. You cannot bootstrap from
      nothing. For chemistry you DO need to memorize most of the periodic table
      of elements and “methane, ethane, propane, butane, etc.” For physics you
      DO need to memorize F=ma, and many, many other formulae. Math requires
      memorized multiplication tables and being able to estimate things in your
      head once you reach beyond a minimal level. On the good side - there are
      mnemonic methods of memorizing that work pretty well.
    </p>
    <p>
      STEM builds on EVERY you have ever learned about math or science - you
      cannot skip anything along the way. As you progress, you ONLY build upon
      what you have learned before. Even as an engineer, you will still use trig
      identities regularly. you still use algebraic manipulations and
      simplifications. There is NOT some point when you can simply “forget”
      these kinds of things and still be competitive or innovative.

      What are the major subjects in STEM that creates the stereotypes that STEM
      is hard?
    </h3>
    <p>The major subjects of STEM are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>PRECAL</b></li>
      <li><b>SCIENCE</b> and;</li>
      <li><b>ENGINEERING</b></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>PRECAL</b></li>
      <p>
        PreCalculus, which is a combination of trigonometry and math analysis,
        bridges the gap to calculus, but it can feel like a potpourri of
        concepts at times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Students are suddenly required to memorize a lot of material as well as
        recall various concepts from their previous math courses. This can
        sometimes feel like they are drinking from a fire hose.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, students are thrown into the world of radians and angles,
        with very little preparation because they were only briefly exposed to
        trigonometry years earlier in their geometry course.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, what was learned in geometry is either inadequate or a distant
        memory for most students, thus leaving many feeling like they are
        learning a foreign concept with little to no background.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consequently, some students have a steep learning curve upon entering
        precal and will feel like they are swimming in uncharted waters for a
        while.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, most students agree that math analysis is “easier” than
        trigonometry, simply because it is familiar (i.e., it is very similar to
        algebra). But, it too can come with its own set of challenges, as
        concepts are more complex and students are expected to not only arrive
        at the correct answer but to show proper reasoning and logic.
      </p>
      <li><b>SCIENCE</b></li>
      <p>
        There are many reasons why science is a challenging subject. Due to its
        high cognitive and psychological demand, science requires students to
        understand other subjects, memorize complex and often abstract concepts,
        and develop high levels of motivation and resilience throughout their
        studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under Science, there are also several branches of study which includes
        Bioglogy or the study of life that also makes the lives of Biology
        majors hard because of the vast amount of information required to learn
        but also involve a lot of unfamiliar concepts (some of which are
        difficult) and require mastering an unfamiliar vocabulary (which is true
        of any science).
      </p>
      <li><b>ENGINEERING</b></li>
      <p>
        It's difficult because engineering programs try to prepare their
        students to enter the workforce. This means teaching them to solve
        really challenging problems. This requires a lot of studying and
        perseverance.
      </p>
      <p>Usually, it's the math or the workload that students struggle with.</p>
